# Syncronizer (WIP)

This application is used for quickly transfering files between devices on the same network.


For example: If you want to quickly transfer files from your PC to your laptop without using a USB or a cloud service, you can select the folder/file(s) you want to transfer 
and the destination location and transfer the files.
